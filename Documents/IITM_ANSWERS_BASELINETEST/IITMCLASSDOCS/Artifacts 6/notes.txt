Design Patterns
 - This is more of a Standard/Proven means of
   Solving your problem / Implement features
   in your product to increase it's Design
   lifespan.
 - These are set of rules / guideliness
   recommended based on an Object Lifecycle.
 - These are years of research to arrive at
   those rules.
Categories of Design Patterns
 - Creational
 - Structutal
 - Behavioral

Creational Design Patterns
 - This is a category of Design Pattern
   which dictates / recommends / guides
   standards for Object Creation.
Few Creational Design Patterns,
 - Singleton
 - Factory
 - Builder
 - Prototype
============================================
SingleTon
 What?
  - This is a creational design design pattern
    where the object is created ONLY once 
    and the same instance is shared even
    if the consumer is seeking for an object
    N Times.
 How?
  - Class Level Variable
  - Static is something that is fixed 
    per class
class GL
  MLS = Mentoring Lession Session
  time (10:00 AM IST)

var module1 = GL(10:00 AM IST)
     time = 10:00
     MLS = Mentoring Lession Session
var module2 = GL(12:00 PM IST)
     time = 12:00
     MLS = Mentoring Lession Session
 When?
  - An Object creation is heavy and need NOT
    the different for any scenarios.
    File System Object
 Examples
  - OS Level Resources Handle
  - ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
ORM
 - Python ----> Database
===========================================
Prototype Pattern
 what?
   - This is a creational category
     design pattern where Objects are NOT
     created instead COPIED (DeepCopy).
Object Creation :- Going through Constructor
Object Copy     :- Going through Memory

How can objects be copied?
2 ways objects can copied in any PL
 - Shallow Copy
   obj1 (0X100)         obj2 (0X200)
    10                   5
   (Shallow) Copy Obj1 to Obj2
   obj1 (0X100)         obj2 (0X100)
     10                  10
-->  25                  25
-->  None                None
By doing Shallow Copy, the source Object change
will impact Dest Object.
When?
 - object with collections passed around, 
   prevent deepcopy

 - Deep Copy
   obj1 (0X100)         obj2 (0X200)
    10                   5
   (Deep) Copy Obj1 to Obj2
   obj1 (0X100)         obj2 (0X300)
     10                  10
-->  25                  10
-->  None                10
=============================================
Why would anybody copy?
 - I Don't Know How to create that Object
 - I don't care about object creation
Why / When Prototype?
 - Complex Object Creation :- Object have large number of arrtibutes
   where each attributes fetch from Multiple
   Systems
 - Create a Base for Starting your feature
   developmemt
 - Create Instances from 3rd Party SDKs / Systems
============================================================
Factory Patterns
 What?
 - This is a creational category of design 
   pattern where we hide the object creation
   implementation details.
Fixed Types is a indication of a Factory.
Example:
 - AuthenticationFactory
    - Password
    - OTP
    - BioMetric
    - oAuth
    - OIDC
PassowodAuthInstance = 
AuthenticationFactory.getInstance(PASSOWRD)
PassowodAuthInstance.validate(password)
==========================================
Builder
What?
 - This is a creational category of
   design pattern where we enable 
   "Immutabality"
