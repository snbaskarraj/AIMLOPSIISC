Clone = DeepCopy
2 types of Copy for Objects,
 - Shallowcopy - Create a reference.
A = 5,       B = 10
0X100        0X200 
Copy the value of A to B.
Shallow Copy
A = 5,       B = 6
0X100        0X100
Save Memory, Change in B Affects A
 - Deepcopy
A = 5,       B = 6
0X100        0X200
Change in B WILL NOT Affect A
How to do Deepcopy ( across any pgm lgs)
 - Copy the contents of src in a new memory location.

================================

Why or When prototype needs to be done?.
