# Your goal is to get per-hour stock price data for a time range for the ten stocks specified in the doc. 
# Further, you should call the static info api for the stocks to get their current 52WeekHigh and 52WeekLow values.
# You should craft individual data records with information about the stockid, price, price timestamp, 52WeekHigh and 52WeekLow values and push them individually on the Kinesis stream

kinesis = boto3.client('kinesis', region_name = "us-east-1") #Modify this line of code according to your requirement.

today = datetime.date.today()
yesterday = datetime.date.today() - datetime.timedelta(1)

# Example of pulling the data between 2 dates from yfinance API
data = yf.download("MSFT", start= yesterday, end= today, interval = '1h' )

## Add code to pull the data for the stocks specified in the doc


## Add additional code to call 'info' API to get 52WeekHigh and 52WeekLow refering this this link - https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/


## Add your code here to push data records to Kinesis stream.
