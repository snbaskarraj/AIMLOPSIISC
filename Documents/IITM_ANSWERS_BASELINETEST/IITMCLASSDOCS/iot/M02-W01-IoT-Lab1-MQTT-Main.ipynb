    "level0/level1/level2/level3\n",

    "alpha/beta/gamma\n",

    "Also a topic must have **atleast 1 character** and it is **case-sensitive**. This means that the topic _alpha/beta_ is different from the topic _Alpha/Beta_\n",
    "\n",
    "MQTT topics also support the usage of **Wildcards** `+`, `#` while subscribing to a topic. There are 2 types of wildcards\n",
    "\n",
    "A **single-level wildcard** `+` - used between the levels\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# To receive messages containing the temperature values of room8 in all the floors of building 1\n",
    "devices/building1/+/room8/temperature\n",
    "```\n",
    "A **multi-level wildcard** `#` - used at the leaf level\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "#To receive messages from all the devices in building 1\n",
    "devices/building1/#\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Subscribing to the wildcard `#` topic directly may result in a chaos for large systems where hundreds or more messages are published every second. Hence it is not recommended to subscribe to the wildcard, unless it is a test environment where the number of messages published per second is quite low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the topics starting with `$` are reserved for the internal statistics of the broker and they are not subscribed to when a subscriptions is made with the multi-level wildcard `#`. Commonly,  `$SYS/`  is used for all the following information, but broker implementations varies. \n",
